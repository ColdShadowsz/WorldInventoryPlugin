# WorldInventoryPlugin
WordInventoryPlugin was inspired by the BentoBox add‑on InvSwitcher, which attempted to separate inventories across worlds but was broken on older versions. This plugin is a full recreation, fixing those issues.
(1.20.6) CREATED FOR KAIDMC

# Features
Per-world inventory isolation for players.
Automatic saving and loading of inventories when switching worlds.

Requirements
Java 17–21

PaperMC / Spigot 1.13+ (built and tested on 1.20.6)
